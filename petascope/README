This file is part of PetaScope, a free implementation of the Open GeoSpatial Consortium (OGC, www.opengeospatial.org) Web Coverage Service (WCS) standards suite. As such, it implements the following interface standards:
- Web Coverage Service (WCS) 1.1.2
- WCS Processing Extension 1.0.0, which grounds on Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS) 1.0.0
- WCS Transaction Extension (WCS-T) 1.4.0
 
In addition, you can find a demo implementation of the Web Coverage Service (WCS) 2.0, which is currently under development.

- PostgreSQL (www.postgresql.org) as relational database system
