This file contains instructions on how to install PetaScope.

BUILD AND INSTALL:

- PetaScope is part of the rasdaman distribution (www.rasdaman.org), to get it use
	$ git clone git://kahlua.eecs.jacobs-university.de/rasdaman.git
- Setup the database (create database petascopedb in PostgreSQL, with user
  petauser/petapasswd), or edit the db/settings.properties configuration file.
  To insert initial metadata in petascopedb, run:
    $ make setupdb
- Compile all in one step:
	$ make all
  This compiles the code, creates a war archive in build/dist and Javadoc in build/apidocs)
- Deploy the war file, build/dist/petascope.war, with Tomcat. If CATALINA_HOME
  is properly set to the Tomcat's home directory, you can also do:
    $ make install
- Run any tests (currently this runs only WCS 2.0 tests):
    $ make test

Please note that in order for PetaScope to run, you also need a 
rasdaman server available. You can download and install it from
www.rasdaman.org/Download

VERSION COMPATIBILITY STATEMENT:

Petascope compiles successfully with Java 1.6.
