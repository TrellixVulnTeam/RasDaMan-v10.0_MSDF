- Completed handling with format extensions, in case of a GetCoverage request.

[dm] 13/01/2011 11:32:49

[vb] 07/12/2010 16:55:03

- MultiPoint Coverage
	- Added a SQL file to add all metadata information for test_multipoint coverage
	- Added a SQL file to allow easy dropping of all tables in petascopeDB (usage written in README)

- Summary
 	- Metadata information is appropriately added to the databases for MultiPointCoverage
	- GetCapabilities and DescribeCoverage Validate well with the new Coverage


[dm] 05/12/2010 18:32:10 

- Completed GetCoverage, trimming and slicing tested on NIR (2D). The request
  is mapped to WCPS, and then executed.

[vb] 05/12/2010 13:47:22

- Added RASBASE and PetascopeDB ERD Data Model
  - Include PDFs for the ERD
  - Include HTMLs for the Table Listings and Description 

[vb] 04/12/2010

- Non-Raster Coverages
- Update2.sql : Creates ps_multipoint , ps_multicurve , ps_multisurface , ps_multisolid tables
- Update3.sql : Inserts a coverage (with coverageID 33) that would refer to a MultiPoint Coverage
- Update4.sql : Inserts a 3D Point Cloud (80K records; will take 3-4 minutes) into MultiPoint Table
- gensql_uos.pl : Generates SQL Insert Statements by reading a 3D Point Cloud File in UOS Format
- README : Updated to add usage guidelines for the PERL script

[vb] 04/12/2010

- Demo Paper: Finished Abstract, Introduction and WCS 2.0 Sections

[dm] 03/12/2010 16:34:06 

- Protocol binding extension architecture setup. At the moment only XML/POST
  is supported. Add new extensions by implementing WcsOperationBinding, and
  registering the binding in BindingsRegistry.
  Fixed reporting supported profiles in GetCapabilities to be computed from the
  registered bindings.
- Fix templates handling - don't parse templates into XOM.

[dm] 03/12/2010 06:20:24 

- Added mechanism for upgrading petascope database in a consistent manner, see
  db/README for more information.
- Added coverage type to the Petascope schema, and changed GetCapabilities and
  DescribeCoverage to properly use it.
- Initial structure of the demo paper.
- Move messages to one file, messages.properties.

[vb] 15/11/2010 22:22:30

- added new replaceAll() elements for GetCoverage() in the Template

[vb] 15/11/2010 21:30:44

- removed loading of template files from ConfigManager.initSettings()

[dm] 15/11/2010 12:57:55 

- Partially implemented GetCoverage, a gml:rangeSet is missing currently in the
  response.

[dm] 14/11/2010 22:07:08 

- Implement DescribeCoverage (a few things still need to be fixed thought, 
  marked with FIXME)

[vb] 13/11/2010 22:40:53

- GetCapabilities() validates with new XOM API and Templates 

[vb] 13/11/2010 19:09:19

- VERSION constant changed from 2.0 to 2.0.0 to make it validate.

[dm] 13/11/2010 17:31:01 

- Implemented templates handling, and ServiceMetadata in response of a
  GetCapabilities request

[dm] 12/11/2010 20:08:30 

- Refactoring the rudimentary request parsing, so that XML POST, KVP, SOAP
  formats can be parsed transparently.
- Switching from the rudimentary template based serialization to XML
  serialization with XOM.
- GetCapabilities implemented, except for ServiceMetadata in response

[dm] 11/11/2010 15:16:11 

- added XML utility classes to petascope.util, and classes that can be used to
  conveniently traverse XML trees to petascope.util.traverse.
-  Initial WcsOperation/WcsOperationParser implementation

[vb] 11/11/2010 14:16:20

- GetCapabilities 
  - Requests in Examples Directory Validate (still need to check for optional
    parameters)
  - Response Validates Partially (need to know
    CoverageId/CoverageSummary/Extension Information)

[dm] 11/11/2010 11:08:42 

- Redesigned ExceptionCode from enum into a class, which additionally has fields
  code description, HTTP error code and locator.

[dm] 11/11/2010 00:35:31 

- DescribeCoverage half implemented (request fully, response partially).

[vb] 10/11/2010 21:29:54

- default WCSServer version changed from 1.0.0. to 2.0.0

[dm] 10/11/2010 17:27:22 

- Final exception hierarchy:

  PetascopeException - general petascope exception from which all other extend
    WCSException
    WCPSException
    WCSTException
    WPSException
    RasdamanException - trown in code working with rasdaman
    
   Each exception has an ExceptionCode and exception text, and can give a
   standard OWS exception report in XML format.

[dm] 10/11/2010 15:13:17 

- Updated XML schemas for WCS 2.0. Removed petascope.wcs2.schemas, and added
  all schemas under ./xml/ogc/wcs/2.0.0

[dm] 10/11/2010 13:25:43 

- Refactored exception classes into one common package petascope.exceptions and
- Refactored all exceptions in petascope.wcs.server.exceptions into one
  WCSException under petascope.exceptions

[dm] 10/11/2010 11:42:55 

- Added Makefile which compiles, builds WAR, and installs it into Tomcat.
- Fixed messages loading.

[dm] 02/11/2010 14:26:55 
- Created changelog file.
