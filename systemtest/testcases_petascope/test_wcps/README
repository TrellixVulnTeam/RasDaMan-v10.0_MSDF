This directory holds WCPS tests. Variables like Tomcat port, host, etc. may need
to be adapted in test.cfg before running the tests. To run the tests, execute:

./test.sh

Do not execute "sh test.sh" as the script is written for bash, and sh is often
linked to a restricted version of bash like dash, or similar.

The output from each test is written to the output directory.

The following coverages are available for the tests:

+------------+-----+-------+-----------------+------------+-----------------+---------+
|  coverage  | dim | type  | pixel extent    |    axes    | geo-boundingbox |   CRS   |
+------------+-----+-------+-----------------+------------+-----------------+---------+
| rgb        | 2D  | rgb   | 0:399,0:343     | i/j        |        -        | Index2D |
| mr         | 2D  | char  | 0:255,0:210     | i/j        |        -        | Index2D |
| eobstest   | 3D  | short | 0:5,0:100,0:231 | t/Long/Lat | 25,-40 - 75,75  | t/WGS84 |
| irr_cube_1 | 3D  | short | 0:99,0:99,0:5   | i/j/k      |        -        | Index3D |
+------------+-----+-------+-----------------+------------+-----------------+---------+

rasdaman collection names are equal to the coverage names for OGC web services.
These coverages are automatically re-inserted when running the tests.

= Adding tests =
----------------

To add new tests to the test suite, simply add new WCPS queries to the queries
directory. Please adhere to the naming convention, continuing from the last
number:

WCPS abstract: number-meaningful_name.test
rasql        : number-meaningful_name.rasql
WCPS XML     : number-meaningful_name.xml
