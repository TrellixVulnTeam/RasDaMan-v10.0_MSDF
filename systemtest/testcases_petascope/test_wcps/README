= WCPS tests =
--------------

This directory holds WCPS tests. Variables like Tomcat port, host, etc. may need
to be adapted in test.cfg before running the tests. To run the tests, execute:

./test.sh

Do not execute "sh test.sh" as the script is written for bash, and sh is often
linked to a restricted version of bash like dash, or similar.

The output from each test is written to the output directory.

= Testdata =

The following coverages are available for the tests:

+----------+-----+-------+-----------------+-------+-----------------+------+
| coverage | dim | type  | pixel extent    | axes  | geo-boundingbox | CRS  |
+----------+-----+-------+-----------------+-------+-----------------+------+
| rgb      | 2D  | rgb   | 0:399,0:343     | x/y   |        -        |  -   |
| mr       | 2D  | char  | 0:255,0:210     | x/y   |        -        |  -   |
| eobstest | 3D  | short | 0:5,0:100,0:231 | t/x/y | 25,-40 - 75,75  | 4326 |
+----------+-----+-------+-----------------+-------+-----------------+------+

These coverages are automatically inserted if necessary

= Adding tests =
----------------

To add new tests to the test suite, simply add new WCPS queries to the queries
directory. Please adhere to the naming convention, continuing from the last
number:

WCPS abstract: number-meaningful_name.test
rasql        : number-meaningful_name.rasql
WCPS XML     : number-meaningful_name.xml
