/** This class contains version and authorship information. 
 *  It contains only static data elements and basically just a central 
 *  place to put this kind of information so it can be updated easily
 *  for each release.  
 *
 *  Version numbers used here are broken into 3 parts: major, minor, and 
 *  update, and are written as v<major>.<minor>.<update> (e.g. v0.10a).  
 *  Major numbers will change at the time of major reworking of some 
 *  part of the system.  Minor numbers for each public release or 
 *  change big enough to cause incompatibilities.  Finally update
 *  letter will be incremented for small bug fixes and changes that
 *  probably wouldn't be noticed by a user.
