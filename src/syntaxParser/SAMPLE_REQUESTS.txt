	This file contains some sampled and tested WCPS requests as translated from their original ProcessCoverage.xml form.
	The corresponding ProcesseCoverage.xml files where created and used in the development of the WCPS service.
	
	The current test WCPS service is found at http://mango.eecs.jacobs-university.de:8080/wcps_0.3.5/
	
	There are two ways to use them
	1) Directly from command line >> copy the request into the file "request.wcps" and run the java command:
		java WCPSRequestProcessor
	   This supposes that the parser has already been generated and all binaries are already available in the application folder.
	   If this is not true, please refer to the README/INSTALL file for help on how to generate the parser/translater.
	   The application will generate the ProcessCoverage.xml file.
	   Now connect to http://mango.eecs.jacobs-university.de:8080/wcps_0.3.5/ and submit the xml request file.
	   The coverage response data will be displayed from the WCPS service servlet.
	   
	2) From the Request Servlet >> This is still under development. The idea is that the user will be presented with a web interface
	   where to insert the request, he will submit such request and automagically get the relative coverage response data.







extract request:
	
		for m in (rgb) return  encode(m, png)
		



extract green channel request:

		for m in (rgb) return  encode (  m.green   ,  png)


		

scale request:

		for m in (rgb) return  encode (  scale ( scale( m,1,0,130,nearest neighbor  ) ,   0,0,640,nearest neighbor  )   ,  png)



		

scale and extract green channel request:

		for m in (rgb) return  encode (  scale ( scale( m,1,0,130,nearest neighbor  ) ,   0,0,640,nearest neighbor  ).green   ,  png)
