WCPS Abstract Parser and ProcessCoverage XML transformer tool
Author: Mattia Parigiani




The application folder contains the following:

- Java CUP grammar specification file: "wcps.cup"
- JLex Lexycal Analyzer / Scanner specification file: "wpcs.lex"
- Utility Java classes for non-terminal symbols of grammar needed for XML conversion routines
- batch file for parser generation under Windows OS: "run.bat"
- Text files containing sample tested WCPS requests: "SAMPLE_REQUESTS.txt", "test_requests.txt"
- JLex runtime executables directory: in sub directory "./JLex"
- Java CUP runtime jar library : "java-cup-11a.jar"
- Java CUP runtime executables directory: in sub directory "./java_cup"
- Lexycal scanner generated source code and executable: respectevely "wcps.lex.java" and "WCPSScanner.class"
- Parser generated source code and executable: respectevely "WCPSParser.java" and "WCPSParser.class"
- Symbols generate source code and executable: respectevely "WCPSSymbol.java" and "WCPSSymbol.class"
- README.txt file





The tool may be used in the following two ways:
1) Simple Usage
2) Further developments



======================================================================================================================================
1) Simple Usage:

Users that want to only use the WCPS Parser/Transformer utility need to do the following operations:

	- Edit the "request.wcps" file and enter a valid WCPS request
		The syntax will be considered to be valid if it can be parsed with no errors and if it is conformant to the 
		Java CUP grammar specification.
	
	- Execute the WCPSRequestProcessor program:
		This will produce the appropriate ProcessCoverage XMl request file is the parsed request does not contain
		any syntax errors.
	
	- Open the "wcpsRequest.xml" to see the output XML request file.
	
	- Optionally connect to the WCPS service at http://mango.eecs.jacob-university.de:8080/wcps_0.3.5/ and submit the XML file
	  using the file upload field.
	  The coverage data will be returned only if the specified sets in the request exist on the server side.
	  
	  
	  
	  
======================================================================================================================================
2) Further Development:

Users that may want to bring modification to the utility will mainly need to edit the CUP specification file and the JLex specification.
- The CUP specification is within the "wcps.cup" file
- The JLex specification is within the "wcps.lex" file

Once modifications have been made the new parser can be generated by executing the following sequence of commands:

- java JLex.Main wcps.lex
		This generates the lexycal analyzer and scanner using JLex technology
		
- java java_cup.Main -parser WCPSParser -symbols WCPSSymbol <wcps.cup 
		This generates the source for the parser and symbol class using Java CUP technology.
		The sources are renamed WCPSParser.java and WCPSSymbol.java.
		Different names may be used as long as the calling program also considers these changes

- javac wcps.lex.java
		This compiles the Scanner class generated by the JLex technology. The class is named wcps.lex.java by default.
		This name is conventional and comes directly from the fact that the JLex specification file is called "wcps.lex"
		
- javac WCPSParser.java WCPSSymbol.java WCPSRequestProcessor.java
		This compiles the parser and the symbol sources together with the calling program (WCPSRequestProcessor).
		Please see the source code for WCPSRequestProcessor.java to see the exact usage.
		
At this moment, the parser is ready for any WCPS request. The WCPSRequestProcessor.java code is an example for how the parser can be invoked by 
reading a WCPS request string from a file (namely, "request.wcps"). To invoke the WCPSRequestProcessor.java example program simply call: 

- java WCPSRequestProcessor

This is mainly what is specified in the previous section of this README file (Simple Usage)


NOTE:
Windows users can get the cascading effect of executing all these commands in a row by using the provided batch file (namely, "run.bat" ).
From the windows command prompt, enter the application folder and type:

- run

Please have a look at the "run.bat" for further clarification
