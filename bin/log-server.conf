 * - ERROR: general information about errors which will interrupt the operation
 * - FATAL: severe error which will lead the system to abort
 * - DEBUG: diagnostically helpful information for developers; disabled by default
 * - TRACE: information that can be useful to back-trace certain events; disabled by default
