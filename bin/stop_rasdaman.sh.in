# stop_rasdaman.sh - shut down rasdaman server complex
#
# SYNTAX
#       stop_rasdaman.sh
#
# DESCRIPTION
#       This script terminates rasdaman.
#	First, all server processes are terminated. Then, the server
#	manager (rasmgr) is shut down.
#       To log in to the server, the external variable $RASLOGIN is expected to hold
#       an ID string (see rasdaman manual). If not found, a desperate last attempt is
#       made to login as rasadmin/rasadmin. If this fails, no servers are stopped at all.
#
# BE CAREFUL
#	By terminating rasdaman, all open transactions are aborted,
#	and their contents will be irretrievably lost!
#
# PRECONDITIONS
#       - need to have a rasdaman admin login either from $RASLOGIN or as rasadmin/rasadmin
#	- no open transactions or databases, they will be killed and transactions aborted
#

# --- CONSTANTS -----------------------------------------------------

MYNAME=`basename $0`

# sleep time to let rasmgr shutdown servers first
WAIT_FOR_CHILDREN=5

# --- END CONSTANTS -------------------------------------------------

# --- ACTION --------------------------------------------------------

echo $MYNAME: terminating all rasdaman servers

# --- stop rasdaman servers: ---------------------------------------

ALLSERVERS=`@bindir@rascontrol -e -q -x list srv | awk '{ if (\$6 == "UP") print \$2;}'`

# ...and shut down all of them, forcefully (!); any open transaction will be lost
for SRV in $ALLSERVERS
do
	echo -n $MYNAME: terminating server $SRV...
	@bindir@rascontrol -e -q -x down srv $SRV -kill
	echo "done."
