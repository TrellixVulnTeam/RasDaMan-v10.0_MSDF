SECORE
======

This file is part of SECORE, a free implementation of a Semantic Resolver for 
Coordinate Reference Systems, representing a registry service able to resolve 
conforming URLs to CRS definitions expressed in GML.

SECORE is implemented as a Java servlet. As such, it relies on the following
freely available component which is not part of the SECORE distribution:
    - Tomcat (tomcat.apache.org) as servlet container

Security
========
Only tomcat users with the role 'secore' can access the admin pages.

Access to users is controlled in $CATALINA_HOME/conf/tomcat-users.xml
First make sure that the 'secore' role is defined:

  <role rolename="secore"/>

Then new users can be added, e.g. add a user secore-admin:

  <user username="secore-admin" password="secret" roles="secore"/>
