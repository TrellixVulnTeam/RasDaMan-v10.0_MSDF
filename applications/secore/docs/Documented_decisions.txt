Decisions and assumptions:

1. When generating the definition of a CompoundCRS, the name is formed by concatenating the names of the CRSs that form it with the delimiter " / ". 
2. In case there is a single parameter provided for the RESTful request, it is defaulted to the name of the resource
3. If there are more than one parameter in the REST request, it is considered to be of the form "authority/version/code"
4. If there are more than one parameter in the GET request, it should contain at least the "code=" key with the respective value. The default authority is EPSG and version is 0.
5. The GML response is preceded by the XML tag defining the document type
