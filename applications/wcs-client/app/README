NOTE: if one needs to copy this ows folder to replace the existing ows folder of petascope inside tomcat, e.g:
apache-tomcat-8.5.34/webapps/rasdaman/WEB-INF/classes/public

then, copy the index.html file to the ows folder first and replace the old one in tomcat, 
otherwise, petascope cannot find the index.html file and return error.
