This project is the Petascope database schema migration application. It relies on
the petascope core project for all the common classes and jar libraries, such as 
Spring, Hibernate, etc. Any change to migrate old petascopedb to new one should 
be made in this project. The output is a jar file rasdaman-geo-migration.jar which 
is used by migrate_petascopedb.sh.

NOTE: the resources folder is a symbolic link from petascope_main/src/main/resources. 
If petascope_main is renamed or the location of the original directory is otherwise
changed, it is necessary to recreate the symbolic link.
