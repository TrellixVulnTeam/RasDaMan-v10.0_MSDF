-- update_db.sh 

Automate update of the petascope database. This script expects a local
settings.properties file, if it's not found then it automatically copies the
default sample file from src/main/resources. It is recommended that you
manually copy the sample file and adapt to your environment if needed, and then
execute update_db.sh

When installing petascope for the first time, update_db.sh will create the
initial database and insert the NIR sample data in rasdaman. Otherwise it will
only update the database (if there are any new updates since the last update).

In either case, it expects:
 * an existing database in PostgreSQL as specified by the property metadata_url
   in settings.properties
 * and a PostgreSQL user that can modify this database and can login via ident
   authentication

IMPORTANT: don't execute update_db.sh with sh, but with bash. Best is to
chmod +x update_db.sh, and execute it with ./update_db.sh

-- updateN.sql

These files contain SQL statements that update the petascope database. Any
changes should be put in a new updateN.sql file, where N is the next update
number. The update can then be executed with the update_db.sh script.

-- droptables.sql

Add DROP command at the end for any new tables added further.
when deleting; rename this file to updateX.sql where X is the last (to be) number
run $bash update_db.sh X
