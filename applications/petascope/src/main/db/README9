The new tables for `petascopedb' can be added by simply importing the init9.sql file:

$ psql --set ON_ERROR_STOP=on --single-transaction -f init9.sql petascopedb

Currently, the prefix ``ps9_'' will highlight the new tables for Petascope 9.
To *visualize* the schema structure you could look into the 
`<rasdaman>/manuals_and_examples/manuals/doc-petascope-schema/' folder for help.
To see the available tables and triggers from command line instead, you could type:

petascopedb=# \dt ps9_*
petascopedb=# \dft
