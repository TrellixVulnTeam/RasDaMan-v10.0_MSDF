# SYNOPSIS
#    migration_petascopedb.sh
# Description
#    This script is used to migrate coverages imported by wcst_import, OWS Service 
#    metadata and WMS 1.3 layers (see: http://rasdaman.org/wiki/Petascope_9.5#Howtomigrate).
#    There are 2 types of migration:
#     - Migrate petascopedb 9.4 or older. After the migration, the old petascopedb is 
#       backed up at petascope_94_backup.    
#     - Migrate petascopedb 9.5 or newer to a different database name or different database
#       (e.g. PostgreSQL to HSQLDB).
#
# Preconditions
#    - The petascope web application must not be running (e.g: in Tomcat) while migrating 
#      to protected the existing data integrity.
