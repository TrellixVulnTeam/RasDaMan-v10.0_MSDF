PetaScope 9
-----------

This is an interim application folder for shared development of Petascope 
while support for separate feature branches in the Patch Manager is still not ready.

By no means these sources are meant to be stable, or even compilable.
As soon as the separate branches will be available, a single ``petascope/'' directory
will be present in the repo, as usual.

*** IMPORTANT ***
Due to unnecessary data overhead, libraries have not been copied here, and
developers must explicitly link to the `lib/' folder in the `petascope/' directory.
*****************

Petascope for rasdaman 9.0 release will include:

  * spatio-temporal CRS management via URIs and the CRS resolver (SECORE);
  * new database schema for the support of rotated and irregular coverages;
  * support for irregular time-series of images;

Further information with regards to the `petascopedb' database schema 
can be found in ./src/main/db/README.
