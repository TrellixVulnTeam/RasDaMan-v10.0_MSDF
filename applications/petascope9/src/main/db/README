The new tables for `petascopedb' can be added by simply importing the ini9_schema.sql file:

$ psql petascopedb
petascopedb=# \i <rasdaman>/applications/petascope9/src/main/db/petascope/init9_schema.sql

Currently, the prefix ``ps9_'' will highlight the new tables for Petascope 9.
To *visualize* the schema structure you could look into the 
`<rasdaman>/manuals_and_examples/manuals/doc-petascope-schema/' folder for help.
To see the available tables and triggers from command line instead, you could type:

petascopedb=# \dt ps9_*
petascopedb=# \dft
