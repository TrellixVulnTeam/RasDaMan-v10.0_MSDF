/*@Doc:

InlineTile is the persistent class for storing the contents of MDD tiles
in the database.  it can be stored as a blobtile or inlined:
in inlined mode multiple inlinetiles are stored as one blob in the database.
memory management and modification management is critical.
there are special functions in objectbroker to retrieve inlinetiles.
they can only be inlined by a dbtcindex.
